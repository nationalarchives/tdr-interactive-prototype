        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Transfer Digital Records Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Getting started</h2>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is TDR?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is The National Archives (TNA) new digital transfer service that helps Public Record Bodies prepare and transfer their selected digital public records to TNA for permanent preservation.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">TDR is a preparation area where records are uploaded to prepare for transfer. Whilst records remain uploaded in TDR, they continue to be the responsibility of and owned by the transferring body. For example, while in TDR the transferring body will be accountable for any FOI requests. The custody of records is only transferred to TNA when exported during the final stage of the TDR process.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How does TDR work?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A digital records transfer using TDR involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Users upload selected digital records to TDR</li>
            <li>TDR checks that the records are free of computer viruses or other malware</li>
            <li>TDR runs DROID to identify file formats and generate some basic file-level metadata</li>
            <li>Users are asked to confirm that the records have been selected, sensitivity reviewed and meet our requirements for transfer</li>
            <li>If all checks have been passed, users can formally transfer custody of the records to The National Archives</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="govuk-body">Please note, as records are being uploaded in steps 1-4, ownership of records and any responsibilities such as accountability for FOI requests, remains with the transferring body. The records only become TNA’s responsibility at the end of step 5.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once received at The National Archives, the records will be preserved and (where appropriate) released to the public via <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">Discovery</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is private beta?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">TDR is being built using an agile approach. Private beta is an early agile stage where the service is still being developed and does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support. For example, TDR can currently only accept records that are open (i.e. no FOI exemptions apply), Crown Copyright and in English.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">At this private beta stage, the service is also only available to an invited group of users. Over time, we will make TDR available to more departments and will continue to develop the service in consultation with our users, to add support for closed records and more complex types of records.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">My username and password do not work</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your username and password can be found on your invitation email. If you forget your password, use the ‘I’ve forgotten my password’ link on the sign-in page to reset it. If you still cannot sign in, please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a series reference?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A series reference is a label that is assigned to a set of archived records. It contains both numbers and letters and can be found on your invitation email.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I cannot choose my series reference</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot find your series reference in the dropdown list on the ‘Series reference’ page when you begin the transfer process, please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a consignment reference?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A consignment reference is a unique label assigned to each consignment (batch) of digital records that have been uploaded to TDR. Your dashboard and transfer summary will show you your consignment reference.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are Public Records?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Public Records are records created or held by any UK government department or related body. The National Archives can usually only accept Public Records.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How do I know if my records are Crown Copyright?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Works created by officers or servants of the crown during the course of their duties are Crown Copyright. This includes material created by ministers, civil servants, government departments and agencies. The National Archives will accept Public Records that are not Crown Copyright, however during this initial private beta stage, you cannot currently use TDR to transfer them to us.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The records I wish to transfer are in another language (for example, Welsh)</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The National Archives accepts records in any language. However, during this initial private beta stage, TDR can only accept records that are in English. Please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> to discuss the best way to transfer records that are not in English.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Which browsers are supported?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Currently, the only browser not supported is Internet Explorer. We advise you to use a different browser to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The transfer process</h2>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What file formats are accepted?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We also cannot currently accept zip files via TDR, please contact us <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> if you wish to transfer these.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How do I identify thumb.dbs, .exe. files password protected or zip file within my folder?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Files such as thumbnail images (thumbs.db) and system files, password protected and encrypted files are not usually selected for permanent preservation and although they will not cause your consignment to fail we advise you do not upload these.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To identify these files, search your folder for the file extensions (thumb.dbs, .exe and .zip). For password protected files, click to view folder options and select ‘hidden files and folders’. These files will usually be identified as part of your selection and sensitivity review process.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why can’t I drag and drop or upload files?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">This may happen for several reasons. To try to resolve the issue, first check your internet connection is strong and stable. It may also help to refresh the page (though this might mean you have to begin the transfer process again). You can also check your folder is not corrupted or damaged by opening it on your computer. If you still cannot upload your files please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Can I upload multiple folders?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can only upload one top-level folder per consignment. However, that folder can contain multiple files and sub-folders.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Is there an upload limit?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We recommend that each file is no more than 2GB and that you upload no more than 500 files per consignment. Uploading more than the recommended size increases the likelihood of errors occurring and may take longer to be uploaded and checked. If your files are very large and cannot be uploaded, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Can I upload a folder via OneDrive/ Google Drive/ Sharepoint?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">During this initial private beta stage, TDR can only accept records that are being transferred from shared drives. Please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> to discuss the best way to transfer records if you are not storing them in a shared drive. For future releases we will be accepting consignments transferred from the cloud.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I’ve uploaded files that I do not wish to be transferred</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">During private beta, if you upload files you do not wish to transfer you will need to contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> and begin the process again. Prior to upload, please check that each of the files are intended to be uploaded and transferred. The easiest way to remove files you do not wish to be transferred, is to remove those files prior to upload. TDR does not currently allow you to amend your files once the transfer process has begun.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The session timed out before I completed the upload process</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A session can time out during the upload process if your internet connection is weak or if your files are very large. If your session times out, please check your dashboard to see whether your upload was complete. If so, you can continue with your transfer. If your files were not uploaded successfully you must begin the process again. To avoid the session timing out, please ensure you have a strong, stable internet connection.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if I close my browser accidentally during upload??</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you close your browser during upload your records may not be uploaded successfully. You will need to return to the start and begin the upload process again.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What do the checks that are being carried out mean?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">During upload, files are checked to ensure they can be transferred. The following checks are performed:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Anti virus</li>
            <p class="govuk-body">A check performed to scan for viruses and other malware. We cannot accept infected files.</p>
            <li>File format identification</li>
            <p class="govuk-body">A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer. We accept most types of formats, but ones we haven’t seen before may need further investigation. You may be contacted if your transfer contains unidentified file formats.</p>
            <li>Validating data integrity</li>
            <p class="govuk-body">A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer. We accept most types of formats, but ones we haven’t seen before may need further investigation. You may be contacted if your transfer contains unidentified file formats.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Once I have uploaded my records does that mean TNA now has them?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Upload and export are two completely different stages within the transfer process. Uploading records into TDR does not mean that The National Archives has them. When files have only been uploaded, checks are carried out on your records to help you confirm that they are suitable for transfer. At this point you are still responsible for them, including responsibility for FOI requests.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once the checks are completed, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of the records to The National Archives. This is the export stage. We only take custody of your records once you confirm the transfer of custody at the export and final stage of the process.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">At what point have I transferred the files?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once your records have been uploaded and checked, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer them to The National Archives. You should keep a copy of your records until we confirm receipt at The National Archives. While TDR is at a private beta stage, this may take us up to 90 days. We will also notify you when your records have been released to the public.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What metadata will be captured in TDR?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">DROID</a> was developed by The National Archives primarily to identify file formats, and it is also used to generate metadata for the transfer. During the upload process, TDR runs DROID to generate checksums, identify file formats and automatically captures the following metadata from the consignment:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>File path</li>
            <li>File name</li>
            <li>Date (usually last modified)</li>
            <li>Type (distinction between folder and file)</li>
            <li>Checksum</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why are you asking me to add descriptive metadata?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">During the upload process, TDR runs DROID to capture basic file-level metadata. However, if you have additional information about your records, you should add this. We strongly recommend that you supply this information to us. It can include anything from descriptions to additional dates and any additional data that will provide context to the record and make it easier to find in the future. To do this during private beta, you will need to download DROID and create a metadata scheme. For further assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why do I need to export my records when I have already uploaded them to TDR?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">TDR is a service that prepares records to be transferred. When you upload your records, you still have legal custody over them and are still responsible for any FOI requests. At the final stage of TDR you will be asked to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of your records to TNA. When confirmed, both the records and legal custody will be exported to TNA. Until you are notified that your records have been successfully transferred and are live on <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">Discovery</a>, it is important that you keep your records safe and do not delete them or alternatively, keep a copy of your records.</p>
        
        
       
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">General</h2>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can I contact if I have a query?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> if your query is regarding the transfer process, the status of your transfer or to report an error or issue you have encountered. You can also contact us if you have more general queries regarding the suitability of records for transfer, file format or transfer agreement criteria.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I have not received an email to notify me that my records are in the archive</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">This process can take up to 90 days. If you do not receive an email after this time, please contact <a href="mailto:tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where can I see the history of my consignments?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">For TDR private beta this is an undeveloped feature. In the future when using TDR, you will be able to check the status and history of your consignments by visiting your dashboard. This will be accessed via the start page.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Can I share my sign-in information?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">To use this service, you must be invited to do so via an invitation email which provides your personal sign-in information. You must not share sign-in information with anyone else. Please keep your details safe and secure.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When using TDR, how secure are my records?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Security is a critical consideration for TDR. Throughout development we have followed <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security">NCSC guidance</a> on securing cloud-based services and applying the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/">Center for Internet Security controls</a>. We also conduct regular threat modelling exercises following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE</a> approach and we will be engaging independent penetration testers before launching the service. We have engaged early with NCSC Technical Security Architects and have acted upon any recommendations they have made, and we will be asking NCSC to review the service again before we move into a public beta phase. In addition, we follow the GDS design standards and have held, and passed, an Alpha GDS internal assessment.</p>
